## Introduction

**snnUNet** is an interface for the training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference of [nnUNet (v1)](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1). It is part of the [**CartiMorph Toolbox**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph-Toolbox) and the [**CartiMorph**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph) project. If you use **snnUNet**, please cite the CartiMorph and nnUNet paper.

## Quick Start

1. Install Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda)
2. Install snnUNet
3. Launch snnUNet for model training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference

## Features

- Auto-configuration of computing environment
- Automatic image standardization (reorientation & resampling)
- Model training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference (only support 3D full-resolution nnUNet)
- Model loading and exportation for easy model sharing
